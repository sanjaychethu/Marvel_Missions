###  ****Task1: Working with Pandas and Matplotlib****


### Introduction

 ****Pandas**** and ****Matplotlib**** is utilized to visualize the monthly launches of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The dataset, sourced from ISRO's historical launch records, offers insights into the organization's launch activities over time. The Real Python tutorial on plotting with Matplotlib serves as a reference for creating informative visualizations.


### Methodology
This analysis revolves around the manipulation of Pandas and the visualization of Matplotlib. The dataset focuses  ****ISRO launches**** on a monthly basis, provides the canvas for our visual exploration.

### Code Implementation
Embarking on our mission, we follow the footsteps of seasoned data explorers as outlined in the Real Python tutorial: [Pandas Plotting in Python (Guide)](https://realpython.com/pandas-plot-python/). Our aim is to unveil the narrative of ISRO's monthly launches through three distinct lenses: a line graph, a bar graph, and a scatter plot.

### ****Task 5: Get familiar with the command line on ubuntu and do the following subtasks****

****Objective:**** Familiarize with the command line on Ubuntu and perform specified subtasks.  


****Change Directory:**** Moved into the "test" folder using the `cd` command.  
 ****Blank File Creation:**** A blank file named "blank_file.txt" was created using the `touch` command.  
****Listing Files:**** Checked the contents of the folder with `ls` to ensure the creation of the blank file.  
 ****Multiple Folder Creation:**** Used a loop to create 2600 folders named "M1", "M2", ..., "M2600". This can be modified based on the specific naming convention.  
 ****Concatenating Text Files:**** Assuming there are two text files, "file1.txt" and "file2.txt," I used the `cat` command to concatenate them and display the combined content on the terminal.
